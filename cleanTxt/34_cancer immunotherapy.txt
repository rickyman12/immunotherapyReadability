Children with certain cancers and other disorders of the blood and immune system may benefit from cellular immunotherapy at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). Doctors at Children's Hospital were the first to begin offering cell therapy in pediatrics as part of a pilot study in 2012. Our doctors and researchers helped develop the first national and international clinical trials for an immunotherapy known as chimeric antigen receptor (“CAR”) T-cell therapy for children with advanced acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). CAR T-cell therapy for B-cell ALL was the first-ever cell therapy to receive FDA approval. Stephan Grupp, MD, PhD, Chief of the Cellular Therapy and Transplant Section at CHOP, was the lead investigator for the global trial led by Novartis.

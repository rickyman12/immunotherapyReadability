>Applications >xCELLigence >Cancer ImmunotherapyCancer ImmunotherapyIs your current in vitro assay truly predictive of in vivo outcomes?In addition to being robust and simple, the ideal in vitro assay closely mimics activity in vivo. The ideal in vitro assay  must also predict long term behavior in animal models, and ultimately, in human patients.To gain a more complete view of cancer cell killing, the xCELLigence® Real Time Cell Analysis (RTCA) technology captures dynamic cell behavior that can be missed by labor-intensive endpoint methods.See specific examples of xCELLigence® RTCA immune cell

These biosensors continuously and non-invasively monitor changes in cell number, cell size, and cell-substrate attachment quality.Step 1: Adherent target cells (i.e. tumor cells) are first seeded in E-Plate wells. The biosensor signal, which is plotted as a unitless parameter called “Cell Index”, increases as cells attach and proliferate and then plateaus as cells approach 100% confluence (see data plot below).Step 2: When added subsequently, non-adherent effector cells (i.e. immune cells) in suspension do not cause signal changes in and of themselves (due to lack of adherence to the gold biosensors).Step 3: If effector cells induce the destruction of the target adherent tumor cells, the corresponding cytolytic activity can be sensitively and precisely detected. The continuous acquisition of data for each well of an E-Plate enables the generation of real-time killing curves for multiple conditions simultaneously.Step 4: Using an intuitive graphical interface designed specifically for the immuno-oncologist, the xIMT Software monitors cell killing in real-time (Left plot), followed by calculation of specific parameters such as %cytolysis (Right plot), IC50, KT50, etc. Featured xCELLigence RTCA systems for immune cell killing assays:Dual PurposeSingle PlateMulti PlateHigh Throughput3×16 wells1×96 wells6×96 wellsUp to 4×384 wells Cancer Immunotherapy Supporting Information:Application Notes:Real-Time, Label-Free Measurement of Natural Killer Cell Activity and Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated CytotoxicityLabel-Free Assay for NK Cell-Mediated CytolysisBrochures:Cancer Immunotherapy BrochureResearch Presentation Videos:Utilization of a Label-Free Real-Time Cell Analysis Technology for Cancer Immunotherapy Applications Yama Abassi, Ph.D. (ACEA Biosciences)Bispecific Antibody Constructs Mediate Immunotherapeutic Retargeting of Effector Cells Towards HBV Infected Target Cells Felix Bohne, Ph.D. (German Research Center for Environmental Health)Determining Optimal Cytotoxic Activity of Human Her2neu Specific CD8 T-Cells by Comparing the Cr51 Release Assay to the xCELLigence System Keith Knutson (Mayo Clinic and VGTI)Using Impedance-Based Approaches for Measuring Antigen-Specific Cytotoxic T cell Activity Keith Knutson (Mayo Clinic and VGTI)News & EventsACEA Biosciences Joins Cell Manufacturing Research Initiative to Further Advance Cell Therapy DiscoveryResearch Collaboration Aims to Revolutionize Treatment of Cancer through Efficient Production of High-Quality Immune Cell Therapies ACEA Biosciences, now a … ContinuedASCB #628 | December 9-11 | San Diego, CAJoin us at booth #628 for the 2018 ASCB|EMBO Meeting, focusing on cell biology as the fundamental basis of biology … ContinuedUCI Immunology Fair | December 7 | Irvine, CAJoin ACEA at our table top at the UCI Immunology fair on December 7, 2018!

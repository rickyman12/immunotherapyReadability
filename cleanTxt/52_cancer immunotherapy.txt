Nobel Lectures in Cancer Immunotherapy
Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine James P. Allison, PhD, and Tasuku Honjo, MD, PhD, delivered their lectures "Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Cancer Therapy: New insights, opportunities, and prospects for cures" and "Serendipities of acquired immunity," respectively, in Solna, Sweden on Friday, Dec. 7, 2018. Watch their lectures and then read articles from additional leading experts in JITC's Immune Checkpoint Therapy collection.
Announcement: Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer's First Impact Factor
Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer (JITC) received its first Journal Impact Factor of 8.374 on June 26, 2018. JITC ranks in the top 8 percent of all journals published in the categories of oncology and immunology of Journal Citation Reports (Clarivate Analytics, 2018).
Aims and scope
Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer (JITC) is the open access, peer reviewed journal that publishes on all aspects of tumor immunology and cancer immunotherapy, aiming to enrich communication and advance scientific understanding in this rapidly evolving field. Topics of interest range across the basic science-translational-clinical spectrum and include tumor-host interactions, the tumor microenvironment, animal models, predictive and prognostic immune biomarkers, novel pharmaceutical and cellular therapies, vaccines, combination immune-based therapies, and immune-related toxicity. Read more, explore our article types and sections, and submit your manuscript.

ResearchSITC Cancer Immunotherapy Guidelines
SITC Cancer Immunotherapy Guidelines
The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Cancer Immunotherapy Guidelines are a collection of consensus statements developed by experts to help oncologists determine when and how to best use immunotherapy to treat their patients. The guidelines are developed using a systematic process to ensure the recommendations are unbiased, relevant, and facilitate clinical decision-making. The guidelines will be evaluated and updated on an ongoing basis.
Prior to publication of each guideline, an open comment period is launched to allow the general public opportunity to review a draft copy of the guideline and provide feedback, with the goal of further improving the draft. Click here to learn more about the SITC Cancer Immunotherapy Guidelines open comment period.
In response to the ever-growing demand for expert guidance on the optimal use of immunotherapy treatments, our Cancer Immunotherapy Guidelines committees have developed consensus statements for cutaneous melanoma, genitourinary malignancies (renal, prostate and bladder carcinoma), hematologic malignancies (multiple myeloma, lymphoma and acute leukemia) and non-small cell lung cancer.
Work on new guidelines for head and neck cancers is currently underway. These disease-specific Cancer Immunotherapy Guidelines offer a vital resource for the practicing oncology community.SITC Cancer Immunotherapy Guidelines Webinars

Our ExpertsSITC follows the 2011 Institute of Medicine’s “Standards for Developing Trustworthy Clinical Practice Guidelines” to assure a fair, transparent and balanced process for creating each consensus statement; therefore, each Cancer Immunotherapy Guidelines subcommittee comprises a comprehensive mix of academic physicians and researchers, nurses, patients, and patient advocates invited from institutions across the United States.
Each expert committee addresses knowledge gaps in our understanding of immunotherapy treatments for their disease specialty, and develops evidence-based recommendations by evaluating the published literature and providing their opinions on key issues, documenting alternative opinions when they occur.

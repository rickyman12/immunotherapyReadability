Cancer Immunotherapy
101
Page ContentImmunotherapies are treatments that train a person’s own
immune system to specifically attack his or her cancer. There are several
types of immunotherapy that can be used alone or in combination, and they
can be antibodies, vaccines, drugs or cell therapies. Traditional cancer treatments such as chemotherapy,
radiation and surgery are important, but they often cause devastating side
effects and they don’t always work. Immunotherapies can have several advantages
over traditional cancer treatments. For example, many immunotherapies can
specifically target cancer cells without harming healthy tissue, reducing side
effects. Some approaches can reach areas of the body that surgeons cannot. Some
can target cancer cells that grow slowly and thus are resistant to chemotherapy
and radiation. Since they involve
the immune system’s memory cells, some immunotherapies can prevent cancer
recurrence.
One immunotherapy approach
uses checkpoint inhibitors — PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors, for example. PD-1 is
a receptor found on the surface of some T cells, a type of immune cell.
Normally, when PD-1 receptors bind PD-L1 proteins on the surface of other
cells, it tells the T cells that those are healthy “self” cells, so  they don’t overact and cause autoimmune
reactions. But many cancer cells take advantage of this protective mechanism by
displaying an overabundance of PD-L1 proteins on their surfaces. These PD-L1
proteins tell T cells to leave the cancer cells alone. Checkpoint inhibitors
are antibodies that disrupt the abnormal PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, effectively
releasing the “brake” and allowing T cells to recognize and attack tumors. Former
President Jimmy Carter’s metastatic melanoma went into remission after
treatment with surgery, radiation and a PD-1 inhibitor.
Another promising
immunotherapy approach is cellular therapy, sometimes called “living
drugs.” One example is chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells. Here, a
patient’s immune cells are collected and genetically modified to produce
special receptors on their surfaces called CARs. CARs allow the T-cells to
recognize a specific protein (antigen) on tumor cells. These engineered CAR T-cells
are then grown in the laboratory until there are enough to infuse back into the
same patient. In the patient’s body, the CAR T cells multiply and, with
guidance from their engineered receptor, recognize and kill cancer cells that
harbor that particular antigen. Other types of immunotherapy include:
Cancer vaccines help the body to
recognize cancer cells and then stimulate the immune system to attack
the tumor. Some cancer vaccines are injections. Others require doctors to
collect blood, enrich it with cells and then re-infuse it with an
intravenous infusion.
Cytokines such as interferons and
interleukins are groups of proteins that are produced by white blood cells
and help to stimulate the immune system’s reaction to cancer.
Interleukins are proteins that increase growth and activity in the body's
immune cells. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is an FDA-approved anti-cancer
treatment.
Colony stimulating factors (CSF) work in the bone marrow, where red and white blood cells and platelets are
produced, to create more immune system and blood cells.
Monoclonal antibodies are made
when two different types of cells are fused together. They are designed to
attack antigens, which are responsible for identifying foreign cells, such
as cancer cells, and initiating an immune response.Sources: Immunotherapy overview and types:

Cancer Immunotherapy Clinic
The UCSF Cancer Immunotherapy Clinic (CIC) provides cutting-edge treatments that harness a patient's own immune system to fight cancer. These include cancer vaccines, cellular therapies and other experimental drugs.
As the clinical arm of the UCSF Cancer Immunotherapy Program, the CIC benefits from a campus-wide network of physicians, nurses and laboratory scientists working in unison to discover better ways to treat cancer.

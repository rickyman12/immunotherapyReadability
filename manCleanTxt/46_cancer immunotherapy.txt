G. Jebsen Centre for Cancer Immunotherapy
A Translational Research Program for the Development of New Strategies for Immunotherapy Against Cancer

Research

Our overall focus is to develop novel technologies and immunotherapeutic strategies that overcome immunological tolerance to cancer. In particular, we will focus on leukemia and lymphoma.

About our research
Ex Vivo Expanded Adaptive NK Cells Effectively Kill Primary Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Cells

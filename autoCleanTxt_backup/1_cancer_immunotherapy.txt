What Is Cancer Immunotherapy?

Immunotherapy is treatment that uses certain parts of a person’s immune system
to fight diseases such as cancer. This can be done in a couple of ways:

Stimulating your own immune system to work harder or smarter to attack cancer cells
Giving you immune system components, such as man-made immune system proteins

Some types of immunotherapy are also sometimes called biologic therapy or
biotherapy.

In the last few decades immunotherapy has become an important part of treating
some types of cancer. Newer types of immune treatments are now being studied,
and they’ll impact how we treat cancer in the future.

Immunotherapy includes treatments that work in different ways. Some boost the
body’s immune system in a very general way. Others help train the immune
system to attack cancer cells specifically.

Immunotherapy works better for some types of cancer than for others. It’s used
by itself for some of these cancers, but for others it seems to work better
when used with other types of treatment.

What the immune system does

Your immune system is a collection of organs, special cells, and substances
that help protect you from infections and some other diseases. Immune cells
and the substances they make travel through your body to protect it from germs
that cause infections. They also help protect you from cancer in some ways.

The immune system keeps track of all of the substances normally found in the
body. Any new substance that the immune system doesn’t recognize raises an
alarm, causing the immune system to attack it. For example, germs contain
substances such as certain proteins that are not normally found in the human
body. The immune system sees these as “foreign” and attacks them. The immune
response can destroy anything containing the foreign substance, such as germs
or cancer cells.

The immune system has a tougher time targeting cancer cells, though. This is
because cancer starts when cells become altered and start to grow out of
control. The immune system doesn’t always recognize cancer cells as foreign.

Clearly there are limits on the immune system’s ability to fight cancer on its
own, because many people with healthy immune systems still develop cancer.
Sometimes the immune system doesn’t see the cancer cells as foreign because
the cells aren’t different enough from normal cells. Sometimes the immune
system recognizes the cancer cells, but the response might not be strong
enough to destroy the cancer. Cancer cells themselves can also give off
substances that keep the immune system in check.

To overcome this, researchers have found ways to help the immune system
recognize cancer cells and strengthen its response so that it will destroy
them.

Types of cancer immunotherapy

The main types of immunotherapy now being used to treat cancer include:

Monoclonal antibodies: These are man-made versions of immune system proteins. Antibodies can be very useful in treating cancer because they can be designed to attack a very specific part of a cancer cell.
Immune checkpoint inhibitors: These drugs basically take the ‘brakes’ off the immune system, which helps it recognize and attack cancer cells.
Cancer vaccines: Vaccines are substances put into the body to start an immune response against certain diseases. We usually think of them as being given to healthy people to help prevent infections. But some vaccines can help prevent or treat cancer.
Other, non-specific immunotherapies: These treatments boost the immune system in a general way, but this can still help the immune system attack cancer cells.

Immunotherapy drugs are now used to treat many different types of cancer. For
more information about immunotherapy as a treatment for a specific cancer,
please see our information on that type of cancer.

Many newer types of immunotherapy are now being studied for use against
cancer. Some of these are discussed in What’s new in cancer immunotherapy
research?

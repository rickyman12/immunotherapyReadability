Cancer Immunotherapy Clinic

The UCSF Cancer Immunotherapy Clinic (CIC) provides cutting-edge treatments
that harness a patient's own immune system to fight cancer. These include
cancer vaccines, cellular therapies and other experimental drugs.

As the clinical arm of the UCSF Cancer Immunotherapy Program, the CIC benefits
from a campus-wide network of physicians, nurses and laboratory scientists
working in unison to discover better ways to treat cancer.

Boosting the Body's Powerful Immune System
Immunotherapy treatment harnesses the body's natural strength to fight cancer—
empowering the immune system to conquer more types of cancer and save more lives.

ANTIBODIES
proteins that bind to antigens on harmful invaders in the body (e.g., germs and viruses). Also mark cells for attack and destruction by other immune cells
B CELLS
release antibodies to defend against harmful invaders in the body. Each is programmed to make one specific antibody (e.g., common cold virus)
CD8+ KILLER T CELLS
destroys thousands of virus-infected cells each day. CD8+ killer T cells even seek out and destroy cancer cells
CYTOKINES
messenger molecules that help immune cells communicate with each other to coordinate the right immune response
DENDRITIC CELLS
digest foreign and cancerous cells and present their proteins to immune cells that destroy them
CD4+ HELPER T CELLS
send "help" signals to the other immune cells (i.e., CD8+ killer T cells) to make them more efficient at destroying harmful invaders. Also maintain lines of communication with B cells
REGULATORY T CELLS
provide the checks and balances to ensure that the immune system does not overreact
MACROPHAGES
known as the "big eaters" of the immune system for their ability to engulf and destroy bacteria and other harmful. They also present antigens to other cells of the immune system

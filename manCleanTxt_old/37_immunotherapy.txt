Using Your Immune System to Fight Cancer
At Sanford Cancer Centers, you have the option of immunotherapy - boosting your body's immune system to fight cancer.
The cells, antibodies and organs of your immune system work to defend your body against invaders, such as bacteria or viruses. In immunotherapy, your immune system gets a boost so it can better detect healthy cells versus cancer cells. It also makes the body better at killing cancer cells.
Your doctor might use biological therapies like immunotherapy alone to treat cancer. They also can combine this approach with other treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

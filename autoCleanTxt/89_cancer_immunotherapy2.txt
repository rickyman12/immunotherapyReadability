Cancer Immunotherapy

The field of immuno-oncology (or cancer immunotherapy) has exploded in the
past decade

Cancer immunotherapies generally work by interfering with the inhibitory
signals produced by tumors against certain elements of the immune system.
Because such inhibitory signals are mediated by “immune checkpoint” cell-
surface molecules, the first generation of cancer immunotherapies are
generally known as checkpoint inhibitors. The remarkable clinical efficacy
(measured as long-term tumor control or even complete disappearance of tumor
lesions) of some checkpoint inhibitors appears to be associated with the
activity of effector lymphocytes, mainly tumor-infiltrating effector T cells.
There remains, however, a significant unmet medical need.

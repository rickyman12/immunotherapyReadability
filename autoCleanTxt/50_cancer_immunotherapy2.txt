Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy Program

Targeting the immune system to fight cancer

The Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy Program studies the mechanisms
involved in cancer development and immune system regulation and the role of
inflammation in cancer. It also develops novel cancer therapies, such as
antibody-based therapies, cancer vaccines and CAR-T cell therapies.

ABOUT
The Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy Program is advancing new discoveries about the role of the immune system in cancer, with its findings driving the development of immune-based treatments for patients with cancer.


RESEARCH
Research in the program has revealed new information about the immune system and cancer cells, driven new antibody-based therapies, identified potential cancer vaccines, and led to pivotal CAR-T cell therapy clinical trials.

CONTACT
Contact the Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy Program about research on cancer development and immune system regulation, inflammation and cancer, and novel cancer therapies, or for information about collaborative opportunities.


CANCER CENTER
The Immunology and Immunotherapy Program is part of the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center with locations in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.

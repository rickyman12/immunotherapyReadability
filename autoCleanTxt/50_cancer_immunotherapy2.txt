Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy Program

Targeting the immune system to fight cancer

The Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy Program studies the mechanisms
involved in cancer development and immune system regulation and the role of
inflammation in cancer. It also develops novel cancer therapies, such as
antibody-based therapies, cancer vaccines and CAR-T cell therapies.

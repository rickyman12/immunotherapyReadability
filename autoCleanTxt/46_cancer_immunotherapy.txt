Ex Vivo Expanded Adaptive NK Cells Effectively Kill Primary Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Cells

The Malmberg group published in August 2017 an article describing a protocol to generate adaptive natural killer (NK) cells for cell therapy against pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

The Olweus group obtained grant from the BIOTEK 2021 programme at the Research Council of Norway for the project "Treating lymphoma with novel immunotherapy".

OUR PATIENTS, OUR DOCTORS AND NURSES: A PARTNERSHIP
Amazing Margaret
Margaret is energetic and engaging. At 92, she is mentally sharp and physically active. She is an avid reader, walks for 45 minutes each day, takes strength training and balance classes and volunteers in her community. In 2016, a bump on the back of her neck threatened to change all of that.

About the Institute
Founded in 2016 with a series of philanthropic investments totaling $125 million, the Bloomberg~Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy is a groundbreaking collaboration between clinical and scientific specialties, supporting cancer immunotherapy research across many cancer types.

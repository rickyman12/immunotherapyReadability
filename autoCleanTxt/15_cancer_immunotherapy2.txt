Cancer Immunotherapy

Immunotherapy is a cancer treatment that helps your immune system fight
cancer. It is a type of biological therapy. Biological therapy uses substances
that are made from living organisms, or versions of these substances that are
made in a lab.

Doctors don't yet use immunotherapy as often as other cancer treatments, such
as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. But they do use immunotherapy
for some types of cancer, and researchers are doing clinical trials to see
whether it also works for other types.

When you have cancer, some of your cells begin to multiply without stopping.
They spread into the surrounding tissues. One reason that the cancer cells can
keep growing and spreading is that they are able to hide from your immune
system. Some immunotherapies can "mark" your cancer cells. This makes it
easier for your immune system to find and destroy the cells. It is a type of
targeted therapy, a treatment that specifically targets cancer cells. Other
types of immunotherapies work by boosting your immune system to work better
against cancer.

You could get immunotherapy intravenously (by IV), in pills or capsules, or in
a cream for your skin. For bladder cancer, they might place it directly into
your bladder. You may have treatment every day, week, or month. Some
immunotherapies are given in cycles. It depends on your type of cancer, how
advanced it is, the type of immunotherapy you get, and how well it is working.

You may have side effects. The most common side effects are skin reactions at
the needle site, if you get it by IV. Other side effects may include flu-like
symptoms, or rarely, severe reactions.

Therapeutic window of antibody-based cancer immunotherapies

Immunotherapy is revolutionizing cancer treatment by stimulating and
activating the immune system's killer cells to attack tumor cells. Despite the
clinical success of antibody-based immune-therapeutics, notable limitations
remain including differential responses between individuals and cancer types.
Not all patients will respond to therapy and many cancer types are still
incurable. Dose-limiting toxicity is another limiting factor for the efficacy
of several drugs.  Further research is required to optimize therapies and
improve outcomes. We are studying the mechanistic basis behind factors
limiting immunotherapy in different mouse tumor models. We will utilize this
knowledge to design improved drug platforms by applying different antibody
engineering approaches.

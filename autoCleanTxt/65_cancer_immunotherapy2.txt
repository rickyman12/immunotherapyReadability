 Immunotherapy at New York Cancer & Blood Specialists

At New York Cancer & Blood Specialists,one of the many innovations we offer to
patients battling cancer is immunotherapy. This treatment uses certain parts
of a person's immune system to fight cancer.  The treatment stimulates your
body's own immune system to work harder or smarter to attack cancer cells.  At
New York Cancer & Blood Specialists, we use immunotherapy agents including
Keytruda, Opdivo, and Provenge, and many others.

We Boost the Killing Power of the Body's Immune System

We administer these agents intravenously. Patients tolerate them well, with
little or no side effects reported.  Our goal is to boost the "killing power"
of the body's immune system and teach the body's immune system to
differentiate between healthy cells and cancer cells. Therefore, immunotherapy
works against cancer in a variety of ways.

Individual Patient Needs Determine Our Approach

Immunotherapies used to stop, control, or suppress cancer can be used by
themselves for some types of cancers. For others, immunotherapy seems to work
better when used in conjunction with a variety of treatment types.  At New
York Cancer & Blood Specialists, we work with each and every patient to
evaluate their individual needs and identify a clear and personalized path to
treatment.

Our Clinical Research Identifies New Immunotherapies

In our Clinical Research Department, newer types of immunotherapies are
already being offered to our existing patients.  Immunotherapy studies are
currently being conducted at our sites for diseases such as Lung, Colorectal,
Breast, Pancreatic, and Prostate cancers.

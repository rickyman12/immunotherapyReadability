Vaccines for Cancer Immunotherapy

Therapeutic cancer vaccines represent a type of active cancer immunotherapy.
Clinicians, scientists, and researchers working on cancer treatment require
evidence-based and up-to-date resources relating to therapeutic cancer
vaccines. Vaccines for Cancer Immunotherapy provides a reference for cancer
treatment for clinicians and presents a well-organized resource for
determining high-potential research areas. The book considers that this
promising modality can be made more feasible as a treatment for cancer.
Chapters cover cancer immunology, general approaches to cancer immunotherapy,
vaccines, tumor antigens, the strategy of allogeneic and autologous cancer
vaccines, personalized vaccines, whole-tumor antigen vaccines, protein and
peptide vaccines, dendritic cell vaccines, genetic vaccines, candidate cancers
for vaccination, obstacles to developing therapeutic cancer vaccines,
combination therapy, future perspectives and concluding remarks on therapeutic
cancer vaccines.

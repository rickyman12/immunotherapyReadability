Frontiers in Cancer Immunotherapy

Immuno-oncology promises a revolution in the way we treat cancer. Since the
approval of the first checkpoint inhibitors in 2014, and the subsequent
approval of the first cellular therapy in 2017, the field of cancer
immunotherapy has exploded with numerous ongoing clinical trials. Despite
great successes, emerging results suggest that monotherapies are not
sufficient to treat many cancer types and it is increasingly clear that
combinatorial approaches are needed to target heterogeneous tumors and improve
variability in patient response.

This two-day symposium will convene leading experts in cancer immunotherapy to
discuss cutting-edge findings in the broad area of combination therapies,
including checkpoint inhibitors and cellular therapies. Particular emphasis
will be given to the biological mechanisms underlying combination hypotheses,
bispecific antibodies and other emerging modalities for delivery of
combination therapies, as well as a discussion of the importance of biomarkers
and effective clinical trial design.

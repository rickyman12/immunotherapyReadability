Nobel Prize 2018: Cancer Immunotherapy Collection

The Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology 2018 was awarded this week to James
P. Allison of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Tasuku
Honjo of Kyoto University for their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition
of negative immune regulation.

Allison has been recognised by the Nobel Prize Committee for his work on
CTLA-4, a checkpoint protein which inhibits T cells from attacking cancer
tumour cells. Honjo discovered the PD-1 protein family, which inhibit T cells
from attacking by a different mechanism. Both scientists worked independently
on inhibiting these checkpoints, with the ultimate aim of enabling T cells to
target and attack cancerous cells. The immunotherapies developed from the
discoveries made by Allison and Honjo have shown great potential against many
cancers in humans and have caused a veritable revolution in the treatment of
cancer. Although there are still hurdles to overcome in developing this
knowledge into treatments for different cancer types, this represents one of
the largest leaps forward in medical oncology in many years. Their discoveries
were the first to win the Nobel prize for an actual therapeutic approach
applicable to cancer.

The award is of course the tip of the iceberg; the result of years of work by
international teams in academic labs and industry. Honjo and Allison have been
working on checkpoint proteins since the 1990s, and teams of researchers
across the globe have contributed to advancing our understanding of how to
harness the immune system against cancer.

The BSI’s two official journals, Immunology and Clinical & Experimental
Immunology, are proud to have published many papers in cancer immunotherapy,
many of which focus on the role of CTLA-4 and PD-1 in immunotherapies. These
include a review authored by James Allison on co‐stimulatory agonists and
co‐inhibitory antagonists and a paper by Tasuku Honjo addressing the
regulation of B‐1 cell activation and its autoantibody production by Lyn
kinase‐regulated signallings.

The papers in this collection are available to read for free below.

Fight Cancer With Immunotherapy

Each patient's population of tumor cells mutates over  
time, which may result in resistance to traditional  
anticancer therapies1

When a tumor cell is killed, additional antigens are released, stimulating
activation of new populations of  
T cells and B cells that recognize tumor antigens1,2,4,5

This can result in an expanding cascade of immune cells that is able to
recognize cancer cells bearing a variety of tumor antigens as the tumor
mutates over time3-6

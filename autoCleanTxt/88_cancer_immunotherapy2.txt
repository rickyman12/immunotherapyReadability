Cancer Immunotherapy Program

Novel Treatments and Clinical Research

FDA approved treatments

Research at Stanford has led to the development of a number of targeted
therapies that are now FDA approved:

Rituximab, the first FDA approved monoclonal antibody for the treatment of cancer and now used to treat lymphoma and many autoimmune diseases, was developed based on the work of Stanford physician scientist Ronald Levy, MD.
Provenge, the first FDA approved therapeutic vaccine for cancer, was developed based on the work of Stanford physician scientist Edward Engleman, MD.
Stanford also offers other cutting edge targeted therapies that are FDA approved:
  Ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody currently approved for the treatment of Melanoma.
  High Dose Interleukin-2, a cytokine signaling molecule approved for renal cell carcinoma.

Clinical protocols for new treatments

Stanford is developing innovative immune system-boosting drugs that target
various mechanisms of action, as well as multi-modality treatments that
combine immunotherapies:

Anti-PD1 and anti-PDL1 monoclonal antibodies
Cytokines, including Interleukin-15
HyperAcute®-Pancreas (algenpantucel-L) immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer

Clinical protocols for cancer vaccines

In an attempt to limit the toxicity that can result from systemic treatment,
Stanford is developing new cancer vaccines and combination therapies:

In situ vaccinations to stimulate immune response, including intra-tumoral delivery of ipilimumab and other monoclonal antibodies for melanoma, lymphoma and colon cancer
Combination vaccines plus cytokines: Provenge plus Interleukin-7 for castrate resistant prostate cancer
Vaccine plus cellular immunotherapies: Immunotransplant for mantle cell lymphoma
Vaccine trials for ovarian cancer
PROSTVAC – a novel “off the shelf” prostate cancer vaccine

Cellular immunotherapies

Stanford is developing new protocols to isolate a patient’s own immune cells,
reprogram the T-cells and reinfuse them back into the patient in order to
combat cancer:

Adoptive T cell transfer to redirect the immune system against various cancers
Beginning in 2014, Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells for ALL, CLL and B-cell Lymphoma

Blood and marrow transplantation

Stanford has long been a leader in innovation in the field of blood and marrow
transplantation which relies upon immune reactivity of donor derived cells to
cure patients with a broad range of hematological malignancies. Areas of
active investigation include the use of immune regulatory cells to reduce the
risks of immune mediated graft vs host disease and to direct the immune system
towards recipient malignant cells through isolation, activation and expansion
of specific natural killer and T cell populations.

Mouse Models for Cancer Immunotherapy Research

Abstract: Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer therapy, largely attributed to the
success of immune-checkpoint blockade. However, there are subsets of patients
across multiple cancers who have not shown robust responses to these agents. A
major impediment to progress in the field is the availability of faithful
mouse models that recapitulate the complexity of human malignancy and immune
contexture within the tumor microenvironment. These models are urgently needed
across all malignancies to interrogate and predict antitumor immune responses
and therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials. Herein, we seek to review pros
and cons of different cancer mouse models, and how they can be used as
platforms to predict efficacy and resistance to cancer immunotherapies.

Significance: Although immunotherapy has shown substantial benefit in the
treatment of a variety of malignancies, a key hurdle toward the advancement of
these therapies is the availability of immunocompetent preclinical mouse
models that recapitulate human disease. Here, we review the evolution of
preclinical mouse models and their utility as coclinical platforms for
mechanistic interrogation of cancer immunotherapies.

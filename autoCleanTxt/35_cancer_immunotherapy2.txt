Cancer Immunotherapy

There has been major growth in understanding immune suppression mechanisms and
its relationship to cancer progression and therapy. This book highlights
emerging new principles of immune suppression that drive cancer and it offers
radically new ideas about how therapy can be improved by attacking these
principles. Following work that firmly establishes immune escape as an
essential trait of cancer, recent studies have now defined specific mechanisms
of tumoral immune suppression. It also demonstrates how attacking tumors with
molecular targeted therapeutics or traditional chemotherapeutic drugs can
produce potent anti-tumor effects in preclinical models. This book provides
basic, translational, and clinical cancer researchers an indispensable
overview of immune escape as a critical trait in cancer and how applying
specific combinations of immunotherapy and chemotherapy to attack this trait
may radically improve the treatment of advanced disease.

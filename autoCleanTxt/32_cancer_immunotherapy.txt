Cancer Immunotherapy Program

In addition to fighting off infections, a key role of the immune system is to
prevent cancer from occurring. When a potentially cancerous cell develops, the
immune system is programmed to recognize this cell as abnormal and to destroy
it. Sometimes, however, these cells evade the immune system and are allowed to
grow into cancers. Cancer immunotherapy works by “boosting” or “re-training” a
person’s own immune system in order to fight cancer. Recent advances in cancer
immunotherapy have given hope to both patients and physicians that some day
soon we will be able to cure cancer without traditional chemotherapy.

The mission of the UCSF Cancer Immunotherapy Program (CIP) is to provide
patients and their families with streamlined access to cutting-edge cancer
immunotherapies. The Cancer Immunotherapy Clinic located at UCSF’s Ambulatory
Care Center on the Parnassus Campus brings together expert UCSF physicians
from across all cancer sub-specialties, working closely with scientists from
UCSF and beyond to develop the cancer treatments of the future. This is our
opportunity to revolutionize how we treat cancers.

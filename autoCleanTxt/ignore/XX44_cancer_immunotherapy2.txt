SITC Cancer Immunotherapy Guidelines

The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Cancer Immunotherapy Guidelines
are a collection of consensus statements developed by experts to help
oncologists determine when and how to best use immunotherapy to treat their
patients. The guidelines are developed using a systematic process to ensure
the recommendations are unbiased, relevant, and facilitate clinical decision-
making. The guidelines will be evaluated and updated on an ongoing basis.

Prior to publication of each guideline, an open comment period is launched to
allow the general public opportunity to review a draft copy of the guideline
and provide feedback, with the goal of further improving the draft. Click here

period.

In response to the ever-growing demand for expert guidance on the optimal use
of immunotherapy treatments, our Cancer Immunotherapy Guidelines committees
have developed consensus statements for cutaneous melanoma, genitourinary
malignancies (renal, prostate and bladder carcinoma), hematologic malignancies
(multiple myeloma, lymphoma and acute leukemia) and non-small cell lung
cancer.

Work on new guidelines for head and neck cancers is currently underway. These
disease-specific Cancer Immunotherapy Guidelines offer a vital resource for
the practicing oncology community.

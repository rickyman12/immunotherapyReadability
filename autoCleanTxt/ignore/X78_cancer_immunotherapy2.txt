Cancer Immunotherapy - Precision BioSciences

One very promising approach to cancer immunotherapy is called adoptive T-cell
therapy, where T-cells are removed from a cancer patient, genetically re-
engineered to incorporate a receptor, such as Â a chimeric antigen receptor
(CAR) or a recombinant T cell receptor (rTCR), that allows the cells to
recognize TAA on cancer cells, and are then introduced back into the patient.
Adoptive T-cell therapy is now widely recognized as a breakthrough technology
with the potential to become a curative option for certain types of tumors.
However, persistent scaling challenges remain based on the highly personalized
nature of the therapy.

Vaccines as an Integral Component of Cancer Immunotherapy

It is important to distinguish vaccines designed to prevent cancer from those
designed to treat cancer. The mode of action of the human papilloma virus
(HPV) vaccine for the prevention of cervical and other HPV-associated
malignancies is similar to that of vaccines for the prevention of infectious
disease (ie, the induction of antibodies directed against essential components
of the microbe). Even though there have been stunning successes in the area of
preventive vaccines, the history of therapeutic cancer vaccines, which
principally involve the development of cell-mediated immunity (ie, T cells)
directed against tumor antigens, has been far more challenging. However, the
renaissance of cancer immunotherapy has rendered therapeutic cancer vaccines
as a potential integral component of treatment.

Cancer immunotherapy

For more than 50 years, Roche has been developing medicines with the goal to
redefine treatment in oncology. Today, we’re investing more than ever to bring
personalised immunotherapy to people with cancer.

Introducing cancer immunotherapy
In recent years progress has been made in developing cancer immunotherapies that target specific aspects of an individual’s tumour.

Immunotherapy at Roche
Roche are leading in cancer immunotherapy through innovative research, including immune profiling, with the goal to develop treatment tailored to individuals.

The cancer immunity cycle
A new framework is redefining how we implement personalised cancer immunotherapy research around the world.

Beyond the immunity cycle
Roche’s scientists are leading pioneers in immune biology and cancer research, which is resulting in innovative and personalised treatment options in cancer.

Collaboration in research
Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, but world-class research provides hope.

Biomarkers in cancer
Biomarkers continue to play a critical role in the development of personalised healthcare, particularly in cancer.

Potential pathways
Learn about some of the different ways we can harness the power of our immune system to fight cancer.

Linking T-cells and cancer cells

When the body’s own immune system fails, T-cell bispecific antibodies help T-cells spring back into action and attack cancer cells.

Roche CEO Severin Schwan talks about our commitment and leadership in this exciting field.

Rewriting the book on immunotherapy
Learn how biomarkers take the stage in helping doctors diagnose cancer.

The PD-L1 pathway

The role of the immune system is to protect the body from foreign invaders. PD-L1 can help tumour cells evade the immune surveillance.

Unleashing the T-Cell army

Learn how our research and development team managed to separate 200 known cancer types into three primary immune profiles.

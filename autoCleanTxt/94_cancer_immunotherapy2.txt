Advances in Cancer Immunotherapy: Annual Update

Advances in Cancer Immunotherapy: Annual Update

Cancer treatment has evolved significantly over the past decade from a
treatment paradigm anchored on surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, to one
embracing molecularly-targeted therapies disrupting tumor-specific signaling
pathways, as well as new approaches to mobilize the immune system. The pace of
these developments has brought new challenges for physicians in clinical
practice, trying to keep pace with advancing immuno-oncology principles and
research. Recognizing these challenges, this course will provide a
comprehensive clinical review of the advances taking place in the immuno-
oncology field. It is suited to those practicing oncologists and professionals
interested in learning more about immune-oncology approaches and the
challenges of managing patients with new agents. The course is designed to
enhance learnersâ€™ competence and performance in practice and will engage
learners through interactive Q&A sessions with the faculty, along with
didactic presentations.

Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to:

Evaluate cancer immunotherapy principles and how they influence current treatment approaches in solid tumors and hematologic malignancies
Identify and implement the appropriate management of the most common immune-mediated side effects in patients treated with immunotherapy agents
Develop an improved understanding of the complexities of clinical trial design and biomarker identification of novel immunotherapies
Evaluate the role of cancer vaccination and cellular therapies in future management of patients

Target Audience

This course is targeted to Primary Care and Specialty Physicians, Nurse
Practitioners, Physician Assistants, and Research Scientists. This course may
also be of interest to physicians who practice in Allergy and Immunology,
Oncology and Hematology, and Immuno-oncology.

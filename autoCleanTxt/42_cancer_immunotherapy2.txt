Alexander Rudensky and Jedd Wolchok discuss how an extraordinary gift from
Ludwig Cancer Research will impact their research.

The focus of Memorial Sloan Kettering’s Ludwig Center for Cancer Immunotherapy
is on research to explore and develop innovative therapies that act by
stimulating or strengthening the immune system’s inherent ability to fight
cancer.

In 2006, a team of Memorial Sloan Kettering investigators led by James P.
Allison, former Chair of the Sloan Kettering Institute Immunology Program, was
elected as one of six research groups across the country to share a $120
million gift from the Ludwig Fund, named after the late shipping industrialist
Daniel K. Ludwig. Mr. Ludwig, who died in 1992, contributed the majority of
his wealth in support of laboratory and clinical research to control cancer,
which he considered to be one of the greatest challenges facing humanity.

The gift allowed Memorial Sloan Kettering to establish a state-of-the-art
collaborative research center focused on immune-system-based therapy, an
approach showing great promise in the treatment of cancer and several other
diseases. Staffed by some of the world’s leading experts in the field, the
Ludwig Center for Cancer Immunotherapy is streamlining the translation of
basic science discoveries made in a variety of cancers toward patient care.
